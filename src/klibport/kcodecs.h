   The KMD5 class is based on a C++ implementation of
   "RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm" by
   Mordechai T. Abzug,	Copyright (c) 1995.  This implementation                // krazy:exclude=copyright

   The encoding and decoding utilities in KCodecs with the exception of
   quoted-printable are based on the java implementation in HTTPClient

/**
 * A wrapper class for the most commonly used encoding and

 * and decoding input using base64, uu and the quoted-printable
 * specifications.
 *
 * \b Usage:
 *
 * \code
 * QByteArray input = "Aladdin:open sesame";
 * QByteArray result = KCodecs::base64Encode(input);
 * cout << "Result: " << result.data() << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 * <pre>
 * Output should be
 * Result: QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
 * </pre>
 *
 * The above example makes use of the convenience functions
 * (ones that accept/return null-terminated strings) to encode/decode
 * a string.  If what you need is to encode or decode binary data, then
 * it is highly recommended that you use the functions that take an input
 * and output QByteArray as arguments.  These functions are specifically
 * tailored for encoding and decoding binary data.
